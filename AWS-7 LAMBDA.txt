AWS LAMBDA

LAMBDA - DevOps

. Cost optimizations

. Govern the aws resources

. Trigger lambda for s3+cloudwatch = which are event driven actions
  Tell the cloudwatch event or API event on cloudwatch or s3 event triggering to trigger the lambda

Ec2 / Lambda 

Lambda - One thing is compute

         2nd thing is serverless architecutre

.It has two main characterstics to compute family and follow the serverless architecture

.Managing - In Lambda the configurations are directly provided by aws
 

LAMBDA - serverless architecture
 
When an user sends the request only then AWS CREATES infra  for runnig  the applications

and  once the usage of the application is completed aws tears down the

infra which is created .

In ec2 all this process should be done manually (tearing down)

Complete owner of the server in ec2 - server architecture

. Ipaddress

. Subnet range

. Autoscaling enabled or not


->Lambda all the controls are not given aws handles them - serverless architecture

Serverless - . Cost optimization

             . Security/Compliance
          
             . perform regular activities

Cost Optimization:

Stale resources ---> Notifications

                ---> Delete 

Lambda function -> Python -> communicate with --> AWS API
