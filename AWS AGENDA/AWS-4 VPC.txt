Virtual Private Cloud - Having an own data centre and operating

To define the size of vpc -  IPADDRESS Range

172.16.0.0/16 - 255*255 = 65536 - these many ipaddresses can be allocatted applications , db etc..

DevOps Enginner will split the IPADRESSES to particular/respective projects- private Subnet

ex: TCS-> Single Project -> DevOps engineer will split one single vpc ipaddress shares different projects/applications like payment, storage, lists etc...

DevOps enginner will create the gateway - nobody can access the vpc

gateway- like a pass to instances to enter

private subnets - no access to internet

public subnets - first user access to vpc

**connect to internet using internet gateway
from this internet gateway user enters

route table(router) - how should request go to the application

devops enginner creates the vpc with ipaddress and in the vpc there are different applications where the ipaddress is split now the request from out side
of the vpc is trying to enter the flow char it:

internet(request)
|
|
internet gateway
|
|
public subnet- access the public outside to the vpc
|
|
Elastic load balancer- it is assigned to public subnet
with the load balancer we will create the target group of the application
|
|
Target Group - attach to the loadbalancer
|
|
the request passing to subnet(private).Load balancer doesn't get access
so the route table(router)- it will be created
|
|
route table(router) will show the path for the load balancer to reach the request to application
|
|
security group - but as a security to the application the security group will gaurd the application

security groups asks from which port are you coming from or which ipaddress you are having - liable or not
|
|(request)

private subnet
|
|
application - if everything is ok then the request is reached to the application

NACL- Automation for the security groups -- To attach the same S.G to diferent subnets
  or to use the same configuration  of S.G to another subnet ,NACL is used.

NATGATEWAY- What if application in private subnet wants to access outside the vpc that is internet
it is a bad practice to expose the private subnet to the internet

Masking of IPADDRESS is called NATGATEWAY

NATGATEWAY - (helps to download package from outside(internet).Whenever private subnet wants to access from outside i.e internet
             it masks the private subnet ipaddress and replaces with the load balancer
             Ip address or router ip address
             if it is loadbalancer ipaddress it is called SNAT
             if it is using router ipaddress it is caled NATGATEWAY
So actual ipaddress cannot be seen by user.

**DEBUG - VPC FLOW LOGS
Records every access
how traffic is reached 
vpc connection etc....

VPC

It is the one which introduces virtual private cloud in public cloud with the security

SECURITY GROUPS & NACL:

S.G - If we add more security near ec2 instance then we call it as Security Groups

NACL - If we add more security near Subnet then we call it as NACL


In AWS - Shared Responsibilities

VPC -> SG -> NACL + API

S.G-> Servs on instance level

Within S.G -> There is inbound and outbound

inbound - traffic flowing inside of the application

outbound - traffic flowing outside of the applicaton

Default S.G -> By default allows all the traffic (except port 25) outbound

port 2-> Mailing , beacuse to avoid the spaming activitiess

Not the same for inbound

NACL -> Network Access Control List -> Applied at the subnet level
It is an additional layer for security -> NACL is automated, the
instances in the subnet and provides the security
